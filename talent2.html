                    <h3>About it</h3>
                    <p>I started to get into planes when I was about 15 years old. I would play videogames in my console, cell phone, and computer. One day I decided to buy a flight pack that had a flight stick, throttle and peddals. Got the cheapest one and I started to learn how to fly an airplane.</p>

                    <h3>Experience in adaptation</h3>
                    <p>In War Thunder, every airplane is different, it as his own pros and cons. I had to learn how to use different aircraft and how to fight other aircraft.</p>
