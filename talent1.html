                    <h3>About it</h3>
                    <p>I started tp take programming clases in my sophmore year of high school. It was difficult at the beggining but I kind of improved. 
                        On my high school senior year I got into web develpment/design, and its mainly what I do. I did some projects while beein in these 
                        classes, and here I'm going to tell you about some of them.</p>

                    <h3>"Anyone" Videogame</h3>
                    <p>On my second year taking programming, we had to make a project, so my team and I decided to make a game similar to "Don't Starve".
                        The plot of the game was: You wake up in a hospital without remembering anything, not even your name. You see that you are in a small city,
                         kind of a town but you find no one. As you investigate you see that a virus spread rappidly through the world, making everyone forgetting 
                         about their entire lives. After 7 days, the people started to dissapear, leaving no trace or clue behind. You get the conlusion that if you 
                         don't remember your life, you will also disapear. Your goal is to solve puzzles to unlock possible items connected to your life and remember
                          who you are, before you disapear.

                    <h3>Wasatch LIA Web Site</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to do soemthing that would have my name on it and would help either individuals or a group of people. On my last year of High School
                         I joined the Latinos In Action class and I decided to make a website for the class. I started making the website by coding, all of the site was going to be made from scratch
                         and it wasn't the best idea. After talking with my programming teacher and an administrator of my High School I dediced that it was better to use a 3rd party service to make the website.
                          You can see the website <a href="https://wasatch-high-lia.weebly.com">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Portfolio Web Site</h3>
                    This website where you are reading all of this was designed by me. It was one of the last things that I did in my web develpment class at wasastch high school. 
                    I'm thinking of using it for the future when I apply to a job. Its going to take a lot of work to keep it update but I think is going to be worth it.
